# Fetch and Graph CSV
This project is an introduction to Working With Data & APIs in JavaScript.  
This is aimed to be tought in [AliceCode](https://alicecode.org/en) and is based
 on [The Coding Train course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YxDKpFzf_2D84p0cyk4T7X) parts 1.2, 1.3.

In this demo (https://graphcsv.netlify.app/), I graphed the data about taylor swift songs extracted from spotify.  
Then, I listed the top 3 most danceable* songs.  
*Danceability = How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat

In this repository there is a directory called `dataSets`, containing other options
to work with (for those of us who are not Taylor Swift fans ;) ).  
With each data set there are planty of graphing options!
